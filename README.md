# Music Recommender with Spotify dataset
This program preprocesses a Spotify dataset and provides an anaylsis of the data. PCA is applied to the data and K-means is used to cluster songs based on audio features. It guides the user through selecting a song and recommends 5 similar songs. The Jupyter Notebook 'music_recommender.ipynb' includes all plots and a sample output of 5 recommended songs using initial input of AC/DC's "Back in Black".
